# Upstart

Upstart is yet another component library for React.

It's built with styled-components, and is rather opinionated - it's based around
the way I think a component library should work.

It's very much a work in progress.

## Usage

Check out the [documentation site][docs] for details on how to get started with Upstart

## Development

This is a monorepo, powered by Yarn Workspaces (v1). There are 4 packages (currently):

* upstart - the component library
* hooks - a library of hooks that support the component library
* tokens - where all the design tokens live
* docs - the documentation site.

Each of these has their own npm package, dependencies, scripts, and more.

Contributions are more than welcome, no matter how big or small.
