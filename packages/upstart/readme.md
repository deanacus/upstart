# Upstart

Upstart is an attempt to create yet another react component library. This one is
really only for my personal use, but, well, it's out there for anyone to use if 
they should so desite.

Install:

```bash
yarn install @deanacus/upstart
```

then just import the components into your application like so:

```javascript
import { Button } from '@deanacus/upstart';
```

And you're good to go.
