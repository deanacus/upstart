import { PropsTable, DemoBox } from '../../components/Documentation';
import { Grid, GridItem } from '@deanacus/upstart';

The Upstart Grid is a minimal implementation of CSS Grid. It allows for an 
arbitrary number of grid columns, each of which is `1fr` in width.

There is no accounting for rows, due to the added complexity that would 
introduce, plus the 'fact that if you need something more specific, you are 
probably better of defining your own grid implementation.

The Upstart Grid is made up of two components:

1. A grid container; and
2. A grid item - a grid specific content wrapper that provides a grid specific API

## Grid Container

The grid container is the `<Grid>` component. It defines your grid, the number
of grid columns, and the size of any gap between your grid components. It is set
to a width of 100%, so it will fill all available width wherever you put it.

By default, it has 6 columns, and a grid gap of `space[3]` from the theme 
(1.6rem by default).

It expects content in the form of `children`, and can take any component or HTML
element you would like to pass to it, however they will explicitly be constrained
to a single column.

```jsx
<Grid>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
  <DemoBox>
    Auto
  </DemoBox>
</Grid>
```

### Props

<PropsTable component={Grid} />

## Grid Item

The grid item is the `<GridItem>` component, and is intended specifically for use
with the `<Grid>` component, and exposes an API that will allow you to specify
how many columns wide it should be, as well as which grid line it should start
and/or end at.

<Grid>
  <GridItem span={6}>
    <DemoBox>
      Span 6
    </DemoBox>
  </GridItem>
  
  <GridItem start={1} end={3}>
    <DemoBox>
      Start 1, End 3
    </DemoBox>
  </GridItem>
  
  <GridItem start={3} span={4}>
    <DemoBox>
      Start 3, Span 4
    </DemoBox>
  </GridItem>
  
  <GridItem start={1} end={4}>
    <DemoBox>
      Start 1, End 4
    </DemoBox>
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem>
    <DemoBox>
      Auto
    </DemoBox>
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem end={7} span={2}>
    <DemoBox>
      End 7, Span 2
    </DemoBox>
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

### Props

<PropsTable component={GridItem} />
