Blockquotes are a really nice way of quoting someone else's words, and making 
them stand out against the rest of the content. Used effectively, they can
really make an article seem much more readable.

#### Example

<Card border rounded padding="p-2" margin="my-4">
  <Blockquote cite="Bruce Lee">
    <p>Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend</p>
  </Blockquote>
</Card>
