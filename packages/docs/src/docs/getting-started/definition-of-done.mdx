2. The visual design is appropriate
3. Each state (neutral, active, hover, focus, disabled) has been implemented,
4. The API has been implmented matching the API philosophy
5. The API has been documented by way of propTypes and comments on those proptypes
6. The component has been tested across different viewports and browsers

## Documentation

1. Description of the component
2. Table of properties, including
  1. property name
  2. property type
  3. default value
  4. required status
  5. description
3. Interactive example/demo of component, including each variant of each prop
