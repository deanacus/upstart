## Installation

Install Upstart in your project with your package manager of choice:

NPM:

```bash
npm install @deanacus/upstart
```

Yarn: 

```bash
yarn add @deanacus/upstart
```

## UpstartProvider

Then wrap your application in the `UpstartProvider` component:

```javascript
import { UpstartProvider } from '@deanacus/upstart';

const App = () => (
  <UpstartProvider>
    {/*... your app code here*/}
  </UpstartProvider>
);
```

You can also pass a custom theme to Upstart, by passing it to the `customTheme`
prop on the `Upstart` component:


```javascript
import { UpstartProvider } from '@deanacus/upstart';
import { myTheme } from './myTheme';

const App = () => (
  <UpstartProvider customTheme={myTheme}>
    {/*... your app code here*/}
  </UpstartProvider>
);
```

Upstart will then merge your theme with the default theme, and set that as the
global theme available to your components via `themeContext`.
