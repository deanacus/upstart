Text is the main component of our UI, it is how we communicate with our users, 
and without it, the web would be all but useless. That's why it's important to 
get it right, or as close to it as possible.

By changing the size, colour, weight and style of text, we can drastically alter
the meaning of it. Which means that there needs to be a wide range of options for
the use of text available.

Text is currently set in Helvetica, while I try to work out the best typefaces
for what I'm trying to do.

<Card border darkMode>
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
  <p>Paragraph text</p>
  <small>Small text</small>
</Card>
