# Lists

Lists are a very important part of any document or application. As such, special
attention has been paid to them, and a comprehensive API for building them has been
provided.

## List

A generic `List` component has been provided to wrap both `UnorderedList` and
`OrderedList` components in order to provide a unified API. By default it, with
no props provided, it will return an unstyled `UnorderedList` component



To make it return an ordered list, you can provide the boolean prop `ordered`,
or a type property with a value of `ol` or `oredered`:


## Unordered List

In addition to the unified `List` component, you also have direct access to the
`UnorderedList` component. This ensures that you will receive the unordered list
that you want, without running the risk of not passing in the right props:


## OrderedList

As with the `UnorderedList`, the `OrderedList` component is directly exposed as well:



## ListItem

The fundamental buuilding block of a list is, of course, the `ListItem`. Accepting
no props at this stage, this component is simply a wrapper.
