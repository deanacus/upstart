# Button

Buttons are an incredibly frequently used UI component. Too often, people use
a button where a link would be appropriate, and a link where a button would be
appropriate. For this reason, it is prudent to provide the ability to render any
button style as a `button` or a `link`.

## Variants

A number of variants are provided for use. By default, a `primary` variant will
be returned, unless another is specified.

### Primary



### Secondary




## Sizes

A number of sizes have been defined: `sm`, `md`, `lg`.
