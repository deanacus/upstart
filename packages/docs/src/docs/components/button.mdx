Buttons are an incredibly frequently used UI component. Too often, people use
a button where a link would be appropriate, and a link where a button would be
appropriate. For this reason, it is prudent to provide the ability to render any
button style as a `button` or a `link`.

```jsx
<Button>
  Primary Button
</Button>
```

<PropsTable component={Button} />

## Variants

A number of variants are provided for use. By default, a `primary` variant will
be returned, unless another is specified.

### Primary

<Flex margin="mx-1">
  <Button>
    Primary
  </Button>
  <Button isOutline>
    Primary Outline
  </Button>
</Flex>

### Secondary

<Flex margin="mx-1">
  <Button variant="secondary">
    Secondary
  </Button>
  <Button variant="secondary" isOutline>
    Secondary outline
  </Button>
</Flex>

## Sizes

A number of sizes have been defined: `sm`, `md`, `lg`.

<Flex margin="mx-1">  
  <Button size="sm">
    Small
  </Button>
  
  <Button size="md">
    Medium
  </Button>
  
  <Button size="lg">
    Large
  </Button>
</Flex>

## Disabled

Disabled buttons need to look different, too.

<Flex margin="mx-1">
  <Button size="md" isDisabled>
    Disabled Primary
  </Button>

  <Button size="md" variant="secondary" isDisabled isOutline>
    Disabled Secondary Outline
  </Button>
</Flex>

## Rounded

<Flex margin="mx-1">
  <Button isRounded>
    Rounded Primary
  </Button>
  <Button isOutline isRounded>
    Rounded Primary Outline
  </Button>
</Flex>
