# Blockquote

<Blockquote cite="Bruce Lee">
  <p>Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend</p>
</Blockquote>
