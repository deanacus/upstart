import { PropsTable } from '../../components/Documentation/PropsTable';
import { Audio } from '@deanacus/upstart';

This is (currently) a simple wrapper around the HTML audio element.

It inverts a couple of the standards that the raw element has, such as
showing controls by default.

You can provide either a `src` prop with a path to a single file, or multiple 
child `<source>` elements. If you provide both, the `src` prop will be ignored.

```jsx
<Audio>
  <source
    src="/media/sample.mp3"
    type="audio/mpeg"
  />
</Audio>
```

### Props

<PropsTable component={Audio} />
