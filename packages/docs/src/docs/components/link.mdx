import { PropsTable } from '../../components/Documentation/PropsTable';
import { Link } from '@deanacus/upstart'

As well as simple links, we have created a component that will return a range of
differently styled and behaving link elements.

```jsx
  <Link href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</Link>
```

<PropsTable component={Link} />
