# Typography in Upstart

Text is, at its core, the absolute core of everything we do on the web.

It is the main component of our UI, it is how we communicate with our users, and
without it, the web would be all but useless.

With that in mind, typography is the section of Upstart that has received the most
attention thus far, and is likely to remain that way.

By changing the size, colour, weight and style of text, we can drastically alter
the meaning of it. Which means that there needs to be a wide range of options for
the use of text available.

The core typographic elements all receive a default style in the `GlobalStyle`
component, with variations provided as individual React components
