Why create another component library when there are so many out there? Simple -
I want to.

Using the component library that is being implemented at work has been
illuminating on the issues that face people building a component library. I
thought that perhaps by building my own, I may be able to better understand the
issues that can lead to less than ideal implementations.

Also, I've never built a proper library before, so I thought it would be a good
excuse to do so.

## What it isn't

It's not a design system, nor is it particularly beautiful. It's not _really_
intended for anyone other than myself to use in earnest, however, seeing it in
use would be awesome.

## What it is

It's a pretty simple UI component library built with React and
styled-components. It's intended to be completely themeable, with the theme
having been (loosely) based on the System-UI theme specification.

It doesn't include complex components, mostly just a range of base UI
components.

In addition to basing the theme on System UI, I've also built a bunch of hooks
to simplify retrieval of theme values within components.
