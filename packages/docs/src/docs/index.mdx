import Status from '../components/Documentation/Status';

Why create another component library when there are so many out there? Simple - I want to.

Using the component library that is being implemented at work has been illuminating on the issues that face people building a component library. I thought that perhaps by building my own, I may be able to better understand the issues that can lead to less than ideal implementations.

Also, I've never built a proper library before, so I thought it would be a good excuse to do so.

## What it isn't

It's not a design system, nor is it particularly beautiful. It's not _really_ intended for anyone other than myself to use in earnest, however, seeing it in use would be awesome.

## What it is

It's a pretty simple UI component library built with React and styled-components. It's intended to be completely themeable, with the theme having been (loosely) based on the System-UI theme specification.

It doesn't include complex components, mostly just a range of base UI components.

In addition to basing the theme on System UI, I've also built a bunch of hooks to simplify retrieval of theme values within components.
