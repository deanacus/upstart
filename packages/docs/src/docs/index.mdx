# Upstart

Upstart is a yet another component library that I've build from scratch. It's primarily
an excercise in building a package for reuse in other projects, but also a fun
project to work on to learn more about the tools I use on a daily basis.

## What it is

It's a fairly unopinionated library of React components built with Styled Components
that starts with a rhythm definition and builds outward from there. It includes
a base theme, a grid, typography, some common UI elements and more.

## What it isn't

It's not particularly beautiful, or well styled, because that's not the purpose of the library,
nor is it my strong suit.
